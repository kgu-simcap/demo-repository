# An Algorithm for Recognizing Queues for Improved Waiting Efficiency

The goal of our project is to detect waiting lines, which can be applied in various settings such as amusement parks, bus stops, and more.

We achieve this by initially detecting a person's head using YOLOv9, and then drawing a line using our custom logic.

We are continuously refining our code:

- Transition from version 8 to version 9: In version 8, the coordinates of object centers did not match with the video (webcam). This issue has been resolved.
- New issue in version 9: The line recognition algorithm is encountering problems.
